# Final Project in Academic VR Semestrial Course
Final Project of VR course - Game developed in Unreal Engine 4.
The game consists of 2 levels:
* First level is an open world, and the mission is to find city's bank.
* Second level happens inside the bank. The mission is to rob the bank by finding the 5 keys (buttons) that would unlock the vault. At the same time, you should be careful and avoid from bank's guard - otherwise it's a Game Over (depends on the health bar located on the left upper corner). Number of collected keys indication is located on the top right corner of the view port. After you find all the 5 keys, you can unlock the safe and win the game!
